## Overview

CakePHP follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application into three main components:

- **Models**: Handle data and business logic
- **Views**: Present data to users
- **Controllers**: Handle user requests and coordinate between models and views

Understanding these core concepts is essential for building effective CakePHP applications.
