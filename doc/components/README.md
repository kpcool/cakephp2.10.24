## Overview

Components in CakePHP provide a way to package logic that is shared between controllers. They handle:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Session management
- Request handling
- Response generation
- Common functionality

Components help you keep your controllers DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by extracting common functionality into reusable packages.
